# Responses to the survey
## Cole interviewe #1 “Jenna” 
Yelp -- see reviews how many stars, dislikes thed ads
Yes to find food but note to order, thought about starbucks, doesn’t have a problem with walking in and ordering
No -- thinks it would be cool to be able to find trucks
Yes, almost anytype of product not just food-- clothing, etc..
No
Highly rated over close
10-15 min at maximum
Pretending to be an owner(why????) 
Yes
Yelp?
Emails, text messages?
Notes: I felt as if high ratings were an important part of the decision making process… I think distance traveled to a restaurant should be determined in minutes, instead of miles.  Would you walk to a restaurant if it was 5 min walk or a 45 min walk?... I think the average user probably measures distance traveled anywhere by the time it takes to get where they want to go.

 I preceded with the owner questions just to hear more potential Ideas about what an owner might need.   I agree that its not the most practical approach, but I was just trying to

## Stefan Insight

Yelp. Allows see reviews, google maps offers the same thing but it doesn’t always provide info, can’t find food I want. Yelp is up to date.
Food type, price, categories.
Go straight to the food
No.
      6)  Want ASAP the kind of food I’m in the mood for, price is secondary. People just want food that they want. Filter by type of food, how far at this exact moment.
Eat out for convenience, not luxury. 

## Alexi Interviewee #1 (Laura)
Postmates, UberEats
“America” and it’s also convenient
When they get my order wrong and surge delivery fees
Yes
If I’m at a bar, but not otherwise.
No
Every f**king time. I look at Google, Yelp, TripAdvisor, I look at all the pictures and their reviews.
What? Is there one.
Close first but not one with 1.5 stars.
Couch to door.
Pass
Google Maps
Social media
Additional comments: I’d like if the app showed a little taco for a taco truck so I would know the type of food they offer.

## Takeaway: Convenience definitely seems to be key when it comes down to developing this food truck app. 

## Pasty Republic:
Heavy use of social media as twitter, FB, instagram, and yelp to let customers know where they are located. They clearly do not have any other apps that they use currently to reach out to other customers. Their website has them currently using GrubHub, uberEATS, and groupon to help promote their brand/truck.
On the business side they are using google calendar to keep a schedule of their locations and pretty much stick to their schedule. Their schedule via their site is for this week (5/1/17) shows them moving from Brewery to Brewery with an occasional Cidery here and there. They also do events and can be booked on their site.
They were intrigued to have an app that would integrate both google calendar and maps to help them reach out to their customers from an app that would make it convenient to have a wider market as there currently is not anything besides social media that the could use to help get more customers.

## Troy Interviewee(Rachael)
Google maps is the easiest and only app prefered to be used
Ease of use, never lost
Broad terms can be used to find what you are looking for
Nothing other than google maps
Word of mouth are more helpful than rating system
Actual people telling me about the food and establishment
Do not seek food trucks, but aren’t against using them
Food is usually good, fun to eat from
Don’t try to find food trucks
Food trucks in portland are easy to find, they were everywhere and were easy to find
No never used an app to find a food truck
Time based to travel no more than ~20 min
If the app was useful then would use
If it was convenient to use and to help find the type of food that I am looking for
More scared of the sketchy food trucks and not the app to use
Would find an app easy to use and helpful if there was a resource for it

## Troy Interviewee(Trevor)
No, there are currently no apps for usage. Did work for PostMates for a side job for a while.
Their app was easy to use and clean to work with
Use google maps the most of the time ~70%, rest is word of mouth
Word of mouth recommendations are of personal rating of food and establishment
Ratings are 100% influential in choices for usage in food and retail products
Do seek out food trucks and like going to them
Resource to find them would be completely useful
Not used a food truck app
Food trucks are a culturally different, there is a lot involved with food trucks and you generally have higher quality. Food quality is a high priority for the truck selection.
A resource would be highly helpful and would be curious to find other trucks
Time to travel to a restaurant is no more than 25 min.
Using the reviews on google maps are helpful once you can find the what you are looking for
No idea how many food trucks or how many different food types

Add notes: Useful for it to also have additional info on events for the Brewery that they are located at as well.

# Pitch for the Idea
The market for food trucks in Denver is growing at an exponential amount every year. The problem however, is that most people do not know the type of food trucks out there, how many there are, or where these trucks are located. The trucks themselves have had to resort to using different social media outposts like FaceBook, Twitter, Instagram... just to hope to have a client base or customers who would be interested in finding them. If you are like me though, I do not go out of my way to find a food truck because frankly they aren't easy to find. Unless you are at a bar/brewery around Denver then you get used to seeing Food Trucks. The gap for truck owners and customers to connect is so vast in the Denver market that now there is time to have a tool that can bridge it for everyone.
